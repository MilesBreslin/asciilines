This program takes an input of a TextVectorGraphic (.tvg) formatted file and prints it.

The TextVectorGraphic file is specified at runtime via command-line parameters.

### Building

Building is done using the Go compiler. Assuming Go is installed, this can be done with the following command,

    go build main.go

The `main.go` file itself is also marked as executable itself and can be run as any other executable file without prior compilation if the Go compiler is installed.
